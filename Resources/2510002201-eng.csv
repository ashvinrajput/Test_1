1,"Beginning in 2015, a large number of renewable energy companies engaged in solar, wind, hydro and other renewable technologies were added to the survey's overall target population. As a result, the number of establishments surveyed increased from 400 to 1200 establishments. Consequently, users should use caution when making historical comparisons with the data prior to 2015.",,,,
